# Codex Instructions

- use the "test:codex" script to run tests, not any of the other test scripts
- after adding code or making any code changes, always do the following:
  - create Cypress component tests and e2e tests for any new features
  - update existing tests as needed, but do not alter tests solely to make them pass
  - if the changes affect any info in the README.md, update it
- all tests must pass before making a PR
- do not edit scripts in the package.json unless explicitly told to do so
